fix(docker): enable seeding on app startup and fix LLM response parsing

- Add seed directory to Docker image in all build stages (development, builder, production)
- Mount seed directory as read-only volume in docker-compose for development
- Update LLM model from non-existent 'gpt-5-high' to 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'
- Implement cleanJSONResponse and cleanDraftJSONResponse helpers to extract JSON from markdown code blocks
- Fix parsing errors when Claude LLM returns responses wrapped in markdown syntax
- Add reset-dev-data.sh script for clearing MongoDB volumes during development

This resolves the issue where prompts and topics were not being seeded on application restart
due to missing seed files in the Docker container. Also fixes JSON parsing failures when the LLM
wraps responses in markdown code blocks (```json ... ```).

Tested: Seeding now works correctly on app startup, generating 6 ideas (2 per topic) successfully.
