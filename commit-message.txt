refactor(config): unify and simplify environment variable system

Unify naming convention and eliminate redundant environment variables:

- Standardize all env vars to use LINKGEN_ prefix consistently
- Remove non-secret values from .env (use code defaults instead)
- Remove LLM_API_KEY as required field (optional for local proxies)
- Simplify docker-compose.yml to only override Docker-specific URLs
- Remove hardcoded LLM config from docker-compose (now from .env)

Changes:
- .env: Reduced from 35 lines to 10 lines (only LLM endpoint and model)
- .env.example: Complete template with all available options documented
- docker-compose.yml: Remove hardcoded LLM vars, only override network URLs
- validator.go: Make LLM API key optional with explanatory comment
- docs/configuration.md: New comprehensive configuration guide

Philosophy:
- .env should only contain secrets and environment-specific values
- Everything else uses sensible defaults from code
- No duplicate variables with different names (MONGO_URI vs LINKGEN_MONGODB_URI)
- Clear separation between required, optional, and secret configuration

Benefits:
- Simpler onboarding (minimal .env required)
- Less configuration drift between environments
- Clear documentation of what needs to be configured
- Easier to understand what values are actually being used

Tested: Application starts successfully with simplified configuration and
correctly reads variables from .env through docker-compose.
