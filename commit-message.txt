fix(phase-2): correct job storage and article title extraction

Fix critical issues preventing draft generation:

1. Job ID storage (UUID vs ObjectID):
   - Job IDs are UUIDs (string), not MongoDB ObjectIDs
   - Store job_id as string field in MongoDB
   - Query and update by job_id field instead of _id
   - Fixes "invalid job ID: not a valid ObjectID" error

2. Article title extraction:
   - Improve title extraction with multiple fallback strategies
   - Handle empty content gracefully
   - Ensure minimum title length requirement is met
   - Fixes "article title cannot be empty" validation error

Changes:
Infrastructure:
- Store job_id as separate string field in jobDocument
- Remove ObjectID conversion for job.ID
- Update FindByID to query by job_id field
- Update Update method to filter by job_id field

Application:
- Enhance extractArticleTitle with 3-pass strategy
- Add content length validation before extraction
- Truncate long titles to max length
- Use content substring as fallback title

These fixes enable the complete async draft generation flow:
POST /v1/drafts/generate → worker processes → drafts created
GET /v1/drafts/jobs/{jobId} → returns actual job status
