feat(phase-2): implement job tracking system for async draft generation

Implements the complete job tracking system as specified in Fase 2 of
flujo-app.md, enabling async draft generation status monitoring.

New features:
- Job entity with states: pending, processing, completed, failed
- JobRepository interface and MongoDB implementation
- GET /v1/drafts/jobs/{jobId} endpoint to query job status
- Worker updates job status throughout draft generation lifecycle
- Handler validates ideas before creating jobs
- Jobs persist draft_ids when generation completes

Changes:
Domain layer:
- Add Job entity with validation and state transitions
- Add JobRepository interface

Infrastructure layer:
- Implement JobRepository with MongoDB persistence
- Add "jobs" collection constant
- Convert between domain Job and worker Job via adapter

Application layer:
- Update DraftGenerationWorker to accept JobRepository
- Worker marks job as processing/completed/failed with timestamps
- Worker stores generated draft IDs in completed jobs

Interface layer:
- Update DraftsHandler to create and persist jobs
- Add GetJobStatus endpoint
- Validate idea exists and not used before job creation
- Add DATABASE_ERROR code for job persistence errors

Main application:
- Initialize JobRepository with jobs collection
- Wire JobRepository to DraftsHandler and worker
- Add jobRepositoryAdapter for worker integration

Documentation:
- Update workflow-example.http with job status endpoint
- Add Paso 6c to check job status during generation
- Document complete async flow with job tracking

This implements the required Fase 2 functionality:
- Section 2.2: Job created and queued to NATS
- Section 2.3: Worker updates job status
- Section 2.4: GET endpoint to query job status
